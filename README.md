This is a Minetest mod of bows and arrows. It is based on https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=2805 mod. I removed most of the other arrows and kept only the basic arrow made of several ores. The mod is oriented on realism.
 

Changes:
--------

 - Non realistic arrows removed



 - Every different bow type has different velocity that comes from a
   formula containing: 
   
   	 1.bow's velocity factor  
   	 2.player's hitpoint at the specific time   
   	 This works exponentially although a little smoothed. So the less hitpoints the player has the less the velocity of the arrow.

 

 - Minimum time delay added between shots



 - Comments added

 

 - Landing arrow sound changed

 

 - Minor changes about deprecation

 

 - Arrows disappear after use even on non creative mode
